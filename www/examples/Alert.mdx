<DesignNotes>
  <div>
    <p>
      Alert messages are used to provide action-based feedback. The most common message colours used are
      <span className="text-green">Success</span> and <span className="text-red">Error</span>.<span className="text-orange">
        Warning
      </span> is rarely used as a flash message, and occasionally
      <span className="text-cyan">Info</span> is used to present further information related to a performed action.
    </p>
    <label>Examples:</label>
    <p>
      <span className="text-green">Success</span> : indicates that an action was processed successfully.
      <br />
      <span className="text-orange">Warning</span> : indicates that an action may have concerns but not critical.
      <br />
      <span className="text-red">Error</span> : indicates that an action failed completely or something is critically
      wrong.
      <br />
      <span className="text-cyan">Info</span> : provides information related to a performed action.
    </p>

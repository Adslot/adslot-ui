### Design Guide

Adslots' General Grid Guide is a simple approach for creating consistency across
all platform pages. <br /> Using this 12px grid will help maintain balance and hierarchy
despite the wide range of UI components. <br />

<br />

### Type vertical grid

The Baseline Grid layout is a font of 12px which forms our x-height with a line height of 18px.<br />
A 6px baseline may be used for the finer adjustment of page elements.<img src="./assets/vertical.png" style={{ width: '550px' }} />

<br />

### Element vertical grid

The grid guide should flow on to include all elements of a page, including components, iconography and typography. <br /> Try and always align objects to a 12px grid where possible. A finer 6px grid alignment may be used in tighter areas

### 12x12px grid

The Grid's 12px base alignment is used throughout all rows and elements on a page.

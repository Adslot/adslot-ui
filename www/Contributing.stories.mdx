### Guidelines

🐱 Make sure there's an issue open for any work you take on and intend to submit as a pull request - it helps core members review your concept and direction early and is a good way to discuss what you're planning to do.

📜 Please follow our established coding conventions (with regards to formatting, etc), please see our [style guides](#style-guides) below.

💯 We strive for 100% test coverage, to run tests locally use `npm run test`.

🚯 We love lint. It keeps things consistent and protects against human error. Linting will be run automatically after running `npm run test`. You can also run `npm run lint` on its own. See [commit conventions](#commit-conventions).

💬 Ensure that your effort is aligned with the project's roadmap by talking to the maintainers, especially if you are going to spend a lot of time on it.

👍 When in doubt, ask. We're here to help.

### Issue review

If you have an idea about an awesome component, or encountering a bug, please raise an issue on our github [repository](https://github.com/Adslot/adslot-ui/issues).

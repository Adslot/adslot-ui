# Design Guide

Adslots' General Grid Guide is a simple approach for creating consistency across
all platform pages.\
Using this 12px grid will help maintain balance and hierarchy
despite the wide range of UI components.

### Type vertical grid

The Baseline Grid layout is a font of 12px which forms our x-height with a line height of 18px.\
A 6px baseline may be used for the finer adjustment of page elements.

### Element vertical grid

The grid guide should flow on to include all elements of a page, including components, iconography and typography.\
Try and always align objects to a 12px grid where possible. A finer 6px grid alignment may be used in tighter areas

### 12 x 12px grid

The Grid's 12px base alignment is used throughout all rows and elements on a page.
